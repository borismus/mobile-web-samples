Harmony Background edition!
===========================

0. Try out the test page: `index.html`

1. Include `harmony.` and `dollar.js` in your HTML. 
   Dollar is technically optional, but then no easter egg for you.

2. You'll probably think styles like this will be useful:

    div#container { position: relative; z-index: 3;} /* change selector */
    canvas { cursor: crosshair; position: fixed; top: 0px; z-index: 2;}


3. The ribbon brush, which I used has been added directly to harmony.js, and hardcoded as the default. You could change that with ~60 seconds of work.

4. My modifications to harmony are licensed MIT, I guess.
