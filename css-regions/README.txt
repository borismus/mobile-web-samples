Adobe welcomes you to CSS Regions

Adobe is bringing this new functionality to WebKit, and it is already partially 
implemented in the latest Google Chrome 15 release. 

This package represents a subset of CSS Regions related samples that work with
Chrome ver 15 and nightly Webkit (r98925 for Windows and r98912 for MAC OS X).

Please note that the syntax in the implementation in Chrome 15 is different than 
the early prototype made public by Adobe in May 2011. The complete CSS Regions 
Module W3C Working Draft is available for review at http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/

This package and the CSS Regions prototype made public by Adobe in May 2011 
can be downloaded from http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/cssregions/
